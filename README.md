## About
This is just another clone of the famous Asteroid game. I wrote it to get myself familair with JavaScript when I was starting doing frontend development. It is written in pure ES5 and uses the HTML5 canvas for rendering.

Later on I added onscreen controls for mobile browsers and leveraged Cordova to deploy it as a standalone application on Android. 

Currently all work on this project has stopped and it will not be updated anymore.
